# Getting Started

This application is a canonical React application generated with `create-react-app`. The client code is under the `client` folder. The server code is in `index.js`. It is designed to work well with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and to be easily deployed to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/), Azure's fully-managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that let's you deploy and scale web, mobile, and API apps. 

## Getting the Code

Clone directly from GitHub or from your Try Azure App Service instance.

## Running the Application Locally

After cloning, install the necessary npm dependencies and then run the local development server to launch the application:

``` console
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

The default browser will open and you will automatically browse to `http://localhost:3000`. The Express API is running on port 3001 and Webpack will take care of proxying requests from the front-end server to your API server as needed.

## Deployment

### Production Build

```
> npm run build


```

You may want to prune both the root and the client packages:

```
> npm prune --production && cd client && npm prune --production
```

### Deploying to Azure
When you first open this folder in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install the [Azure App Service extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice). 

The App Service extension lets you quickly quickly create sites, deploy them, view logs, and even set environment variables (such as a Connection String), right from within VS Code. For more information, see the [App Service Walkthrough](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/app-service-extension/getting-started).

## Additional Documentation

More information on building and deploying Node applications to Azure can be found on the [Node Developer Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/azure/?view=azure-node-latest).
